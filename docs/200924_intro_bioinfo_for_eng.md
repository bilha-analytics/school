Topics
- sequence analysis
- microarray expression analysis
- Bayesian methods
- Control theory
- Scale-free networks
- biotech applications




## Programming Living Bacteria
- MIT creating a programming language for living bacteria. write a program that gets compiled into DNA, which can then be put into cells

Computation challenges 
- Bio functions require 100s to 1000s of genes and 
- Precision of timing and location of gene expression


Regulatory Network
- protein + DNA + RNA interactions. Involves 100s  of regulators 
- Using language of electrical engineering describe the systems/circutry
- Synthetic circuits
	- E.G. oscillator 
	- But restrictedt to 2 - 4 regulatory proteins; Still very simple. Also takes years of effort and esoteric
- So considerations
	- Design - not enough well xtised regulatory parts. Toxicity and sensitivity to context
	- Construction: computationally expensive and slow b/c large DNA fragments required
	- Debugging: living cells continually changing to env and evolution. many circutry and hard to track?


Proposed Software Solution
- finding protiens without interaction/interference and insulating 
- Verilog h/w desription language; how ICs are made
	- hacked into to compile to DNA instead of silicon
-
